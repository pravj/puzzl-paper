Implementing an intelligent version of the classical sliding-puzzle game for unix terminals using Golang's concurrency primitives

> [http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08345](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08345)

An intelligent version of the sliding-puzzle game is developed using the new
*Go* programming language, which uses a concurrent version of the *A-star Informed Search Algorithm* to power solver-bot that runs in the background. The game
runs in computer system’s terminals. Mainly, it was developed for UNIX-type
systems but it works pretty well in nearly all the operating systems because of
cross-platform compatibility of the programming language used.

The game uses language’s concurrency primitives to simplify most of the hefty
parts of the game. A *real-time notification delivery* architecture is developed
using language’s built-in concurrency support, which performs similar to event
based *context aware invocations* like we see on the web platform
